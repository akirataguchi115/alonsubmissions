Submission for the algorithms in problem solving course in C++(University of Helsinki)
## 01 Weird Algorithm
Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n is one.
## 02 Increasing Array
You are given an array of n integers. You want to modify the array so that it is increasing, i.e., every element is at least as large as the previous element.

On each move, you may increase the value of any element by one. What is the minimum number of moves required?
## 03 Two Sets
Your task is to divide the numbers 1,2,â€¦,n into two sets of equal sum.
## 04 Concert Tickets
There are n concert tickets available, each with a certain price. Then, m customers arrive, one after another.

Each customer announces the maximum price he or she is willing to pay for a ticket, and after this, they will get a ticket with the nearest possible price such that it does not exceed the maximum price.
## 05 Movie Festival
In a movie festival n movies will be shown. You know the starting and ending time of each movie. What is the maximum number of movies you can watch entirely?
## 06 Missing Coin Sum
You have n coins with positive integer values. What is the smallest sum you cannot create using a subset of the coins?
## 07 Room Allocation
There is a large hotel, and n customers will arrive soon. Each customer wants to have a single room.

You know each customer's arrival and departure day. Two customers can stay in the same room if the departure day of the first customer is earlier than the arrival day of the second customer.

What is the minimum number of rooms that are needed to accommodate all customers? And how can the rooms be allocated?
